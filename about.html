            'We love children's clothing. We believe that every child should
            have a wonderful wardrobe filled with clothes that will make them
            feel good. We love that children love clothes, that they want to
            look good and that they want to be in good clothes. We have created
            a fashion website where parents can find their children's clothing,
            so they can take care of their children's clothing and enjoy the
            good times.'

          <p class="about__description">
            The company is founded by Anna and Michael Hofer, who have a keen
            interest in children's fashion. Their aim is to provide the best
            possible shopping experience for children and their parents and to
            support the companies that do. Anna and Michael are passionate about
            children's fashion and the role it plays in the lives of children.
            They believe that children can never grow up without fashion, and
            that fashion should always be available for them.
